Tasks to improve library

# Propagator
 - Construct all propagators from a single module, specifying the central body as an argument
 - Let users add propagators together to merge simulations

# Filters
 - Have all filters inherit a common parent class
 - Make measurement inputs modular to filters so they can accept different measurements at different rates
 - Integrate propagators into filters somehow without eschewing non-orbit applications
 - Normalize states, and implement square root Kalman filter
 - Create OrbitalUser with propagator and clock
